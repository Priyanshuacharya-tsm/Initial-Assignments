                    <p>Hi, I'm Priyanshu Acharya, a passionate and results-driven Computer Science undergraduate at
                        Oriental Institute of Science and Technology, Bhopal (Batch 2022–26), with a strong foundation
                        in full-stack development, machine learning, and scalable web technologies.</p>
                    <p>I thrive on solving real-world problems through code. My recent projects include:

                        JurisTech – a full-stack legal tech platform using React.js and FastAPI, integrating
                        cutting-edge tools like CrewAI, RAG, and OpenAI.
                        Real-Time Emotional State Analyzer – a MERN stack solution leveraging TensorFlow and OpenCV for
                        emotion detection in virtual meetings.
                        Live Location Tracker – a Node.js and Socket.io-based group geolocation app optimized for
                        real-time performance.
                        I’ve solved 750+ coding problems across platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef, earning top global
                        ranks (LeetCode Contest 463 – Rank 86, CodeChef Starters 194D – Rank 417). I was also a finalist
                        in major hackathons, including Washington Hackathon 2025 and Prayatna 2.0.

                        Currently, I serve as the President of the Student Activity Council at OIST, leading a 24-member
                        team and organizing 40+ events with over 20,000 attendees.</p>

                    <h1>Exploring the tech with brothers❤️</h1>
                    <p>Tech is more than just code—it's about the people you build with. Over the past few years, I’ve
                        had the privilege of growing alongside a close-knit group of friends who’ve become more like
                        brothers. Together, we’ve dived deep into the world of development, brainstormed wild ideas,
                        pulled all-nighters, and turned concepts into real-world solutions.

                        From late-night debugging sessions to high-stakes hackathons, we’ve shared not just code but
                        countless memories. Whether it was being finalists at the Washington Hackathon 2025 or ranking
                        among the top 20 teams at Prayatna 2.0, every challenge became an opportunity to learn, laugh,
                        and level up—together.

                        These collaborations have taught me the true power of teamwork, trust, and shared passion. We
                        don’t just build projects—we build each other up. This is all.</p>
